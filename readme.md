# HackerRank Kotlin project

## About

* * *

The `HackerRank` project is a list of solutions for problems found on the
`HackerRank` website written in `Kotlin`. It would be important to mention that
each solution is stored in its own git branch, so the best way to view the
written solutions for their corresponding problem can be done by switching
git branches.

This project is using *Gradle build system*, so be sure to review [Gradle Guides](https://gradle.org/guides/#getting-started)
then see if you can build this project to prove that everything is all setup
and ready to go. :)

## Contact the developer

You may find that I have a number of ways that you can contact
me. All of these methods happen to be listed on my blog
[Mike's Visual Cube](https://mikebrockus.code.blog/contact-us/).

Second option would be to join me on [MeWe](https://mewe.com/i/michaelbrockus)

Lastly don't forget to have a cup of virtual coffee. ‚òïüêáüíª
